# TeapotStudio
Extract 3D models and textures for use in the **MakePlace: Teapot** app. 

Based on [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio) and the [GenshinStudio](https://github.com/Razmoth/GenshinStudio) fork.

## Usage

1. Build the BLK map (Misc -> Build BLKMap)
   - Select the GenshinImpact_Data folder when prompted (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Genshin Impact\Genshin Impact game\GenshinImpact_Data`)
   - This will take around 3 min

2. Load the BLKs (Teapot -> Load BLKs)
   - Even when the progress bar is full, the asset structure still needs to be made
   - Wait for the status at the bottom of the screen to read `Finished loading <x> files with <y> exportable assets`

3. Extract the files (Teapot -> Export files)
   - Be patient. This takes another 5 min.

Done!

## FAQ

### Help! I can't get the plugin to work.
Post on the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/YuvcPzCuhq) for help with troubleshooting.

### Why are you not using the latest version of GenshinStudio?
The latest v0.16.50 is not as robust in detecting mesh and texture files - about 30% of files are missing compared to using v0.16.30.
